  <h1><a href="http://www.pointcontrol.info">PointControl</a>: a new fencing rating system</h1>
  <h3>Ok I clicked your link, what's up?</h3>
  <p>The current letter-based fencing rating system sucks. A few <a href="http://www.fencing.net/forums/fencing-discussion/29851-fencing-ratings.html">people</a> on teh <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TimMorehouseUSA/posts/845271802191255">internets</a> <a href="http://www.fencing.net/forums/fencing-discussion/79203-fencing-begin-using-ratings.html">agree</a> with me, so I made a better system called <a href="http://www.pointcontrol.info">PointControl</a>.</p>
  <h3>Alright, that's cool, but why is it better?</h3>
  <p>A few reasons...</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>It's more accurate.</b> In epee, using PointControl prior to a USFA tournament event would have produced a strictly better seeding 61% of the time against the letter-based seeding; in foil, 66% of the time; and in saber, 59% of the time.</li>
    <li><b>The rating is more granular.</b> After each tournament, you will be able to see your PointControl rating go up or down, even if it's by a small amount. This is especially useful for Unrated beginners like me. And there are a lot of beginners! In fact, 65% of tournament fencers active in the past year are letter-unrated.<br>Seeing progress is very motivating, and keeps me going to tournaments.</li>
    <li><b>It uses math.</b> Unlike the letter-based system that promotes based on archaic rules, PointControl is based on a statistical algorithm, similar to what chess tournment players use.</li>
    <li>I'm out of ideas. That previous point wasn't even convincing... But it's already a huge improvement over the letter system right?</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>And what are the downsides?</h3>
  <p>This is not USFA-approved, it's just a personal project. There might be bugs in the software or the data. I might run out of server money and shut down unexpectedly. Or, I might get threatened by an angry helicopter parent over some triviality.</p>
  <h3>Alright...</h3>
  <p>Why are you still here? Check out your rating, your friends, and your enemies' ratings at <a href="http://www.pointcontrol.info">PointControl</a>!</p>
  <h3>Hmm, I'm interested in the details of how it works and your data analysis.</h3>
  <p>Ah, we have a thinker here. The technical article is <a href="fencing_ratings.html">here</a>.</p>
