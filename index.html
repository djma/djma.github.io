  <p>Hi! My name is David Ma.</p>
  <p>I joined Two Sigma Investments in 2012 as quantitative researcher after completing my bachelor's degree in mathematics at the University of Waterloo.</p>
  <p>My hobbies come and go. Currently I <a href="photography.html">photograph</a>, <a href="fencing/fencing.html">fence</a>, ski, enjoy cooking (and eating), and follow the cryptocurrency space. In the past I've enjoyed <a href="https://www.gokgs.com/gameArchives.jsp?user=sage1412&oldAccounts=t">go (weiqi)</a>, chess/bughouse, badminton, table tennis, rock climbing, classical piano, typography, SSBM, and probably a few other things.</p>
  <p>My <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>, if you like that kind of stuff.</p>
