  <p>Hi! My name is David Ma.</p>
  <p>I joined Two Sigma Investments in 2012 as quantitative researcher after completing my bachelor's degree in mathematics at University of Waterloo.</p>
  <p>My hobbies come and go. Currently I fence, ski, play chess/bughouse (badly), and follow the cryptocurrency space. In the past I've enjoyed go (weiqi), badminton, table tennis, rock climbing, classsical piano, typography, SSBM, and probably a few other things.</p>
  <p>My <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>, if you like that kind of stuff.</p>
