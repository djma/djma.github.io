  <p>Hi! My name is David Ma.</p>
  <p>I currently work on building and scaling <a href="https://dynasty.com/">LISA</a>, a conversational real estate leasing AI, independently from 2017 and with the help of <a href="https://www.appfolio.com/blog/2019/01/appfolio-acquires-advanced-artificial-intelligence-technology-provider-to-expand-service-offerings/">AppFolio</a> since January 2019. I spend my time at the intersection of ML and product, trying to integrate them seamlessly.</p>
  <p>Previously, I researched and implemented equity trading strategies at <a href="https://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma Investments</a> between 2012 and 2017 after completing my bachelor's degree in mathematics at the University of Waterloo.</p>
  <p>My hobbies come and go. Currently I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidma/">photograph</a>, ski, enjoy cooking (and eating), and follow the cryptocurrency space. In the past I've enjoyed <a href="https://www.gokgs.com/gameArchives.jsp?user=sage1412&oldAccounts=t">go (weiqi)</a>, chess/bughouse, fencing, badminton, table tennis, rock climbing, classical piano, typography, SSBM, and probably a few other things.</p>
  <p>My outdated <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>, if you like that kind of stuff.</p>
