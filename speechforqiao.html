  <p><i>Written for Qiao's wedding on June 6, 2015.</i></p>
  <p>What wedding gift can I give to Qiao, a man who has it all? </p>
  <p>Over the last few weeks I thought very hard trying to find a meaningful gift. I did not find anything that money could buy. </p>
  <p>Instead I will try to put together some thoughts about friendship, some reflections on Qiao's influence in my life, and some fleeting memories, all together in a hopefully cohesive structure. I've very rarely gotten above a B- in creative writing. </p>
  <p>To this day I still don't know what friendship really is. Is it utilitarian, a temporary synergy that gives us both positive value? Is it mutual trust, an honest relationship in a world of crafted characters? Or is it a shared past, serendipity seized and stored in our finite minds? </p>
  <p>That shared past can come up in small ways, like how I call Qiao "kiao" and not "qiao" because I didn't know pinyin. Or how we share the same technique to eat pho, with two spoons. One for the soup, and one for the sauce mix. And then there are bigger events, like wandering together in Istanbul getting led into a dark corner and getting mugged, or skipping class trying to beat a fat Italian called Luigi at ping pong.</p>
  <p>Qiao was able to beat Luigi pretty regularly. I wasn't. Qiao played ping pong with a paddle with golden tape on the edge, hurricane 2 rubber on the red side and hurricane 3 on the black side. He called it the golden paddle. I aspired to become better at many things because of him. Ping pong was only one thing. </p>
  <p>Perhaps unknowingly, Qiao guided me through many steps of life. He did not pursue medicine nor law, bringing great shame to his family. I followed his footsteps. He chose to study at the University of Waterloo, far away, leaving behind comfort and potential support from many friends and family. He gave me and many of here tonight the courage to do the same. At Waterloo, he dropped out of Math and Business double degree, thought seriously about transferring to Ivey business school, and then switched to mathematical finance, and statistics. He dropped all of that too. Every time, he was bold enough to explore and intellectually honest enough with himself to change his mind. He didn't settle for any predefined path. You might guess by now, I also enrolled and dropped out of all of those programs. </p>
  <p>And it turned out for the best. We are very fortunate to be here today with few unmet material desires. As our lives change for the better, with more and more choices and more and more distractions, everything seems to speed up, we think more and more about our future. And sometimes I forget to invest in my friendships. I backed out of the Kilimanjaro trip, thinking I shouldn't spend my limited vacation days on a painful hiking trip, when instead I should have known it was the only chance to climb Kilimanjaro -- with my closest friends. One of Qiao's favorite quote is "investing in yourself yields the highest return". In that line of thought, investing in friends is a good second bet.</p>
  <p>Now I don't mean to dwell in the past and spend all day being nostalgic. Sure I will miss lounging in the MC, talking about Prabhakar Ragde, and then meeting up at somebody's apartment for home cooked dinner and an epic night of mafia. But people and time evolve, and just like with technology, we must continuously innovate to keep friendships alive.</p>
  <p>So again what is this friendship thing? Utility, trust, nostalgia, camaraderie? Like I said, I still don't have a complete answer, but however I look at it, Qiao has been an irreplaceable friend for ten years, and I look forward to another ten years of friendship with Qiao. </p>
