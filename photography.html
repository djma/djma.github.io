  <p>I think photography starts with a simple appreciation of images, and subsequently the curiosity to understand and explore what an image can be. Through that process, we encounter many interdisciplinary topics: physics, human perception, aesthetics, technology, narrative...
  <p>In that sense, I don't know when I first started photography. However, I bought my first SLR in June of 2015.</p>
