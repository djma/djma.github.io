  <p>I started fencing epee in Sept 2014, after years of wanting to try it. Being left-handed and mildly tall helped me get some small early successes.</p>
  <p>An interesting <a href="fencing1.jpg">photo</a> was taken at my first tournament in Nov 2014. The lines highlighting the perspective is definitely the main feature. I wished the camera was slightly more to the right.</p>
